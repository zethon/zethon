## About Me 🌨

I am a software developer who is comfortable with a variety of languages and frameworks, but I specialize in C++. I am also very comfortable with C#, Python, and JavbaScript. I enjoy both application and game development. 

Other than programming, I enjoy playing chess and drawing, though I am not very good at either.

## Projects

Here are a few projects worth mentioning:

#### [No Escape](https://github.com/DogFingerStudios/NoEscape) 🏃‍♂️💨

Inspiration taken from the 2015 movie "No Escape" starring Owen Wilson and Lake Bell, this game is a first-person survival/horror game where the player must escape a war-torn city while rescuing his family. The game uses a unique game mechanic where the player must control friendly NPCs (ie. the family) with complicated commands and build a unique strategy in order to win.


#### [Owl](https://github.com/zethon/Owl) 🦉

Owl began as a "message board reader" or "Outlook for message boards". I would love to add Reddit support to Owl, as well release a decentralized chat system where Owl is the premiere chat client. 

#### [ttvg](https://github.com/zethon/ttvg) 📺

This project is as much a game as it is a game enginer. It uses SFML to render a 2D world, play sounds and handle player input. Mechanices like collision detection, pathfinding, and a basic AI systems are all written from scratch and in C++. The project also includes a Lua scripting system to allow for easy modding of the game.

#### [AshCoin](https://github.com/zethon/AshCoin) 🪙

This project began as a quest to understand the details of cryptocurrencies, and what better way to understand than to write your very own from scratch!

#### [AshDB](https://github.com/zethon/AshDB) 🕯️🏚️🩸

AshDB grew from AshCoin (hence the name) when I realized the work I was doing for a simple write-once-read-often index-based database could be its own project.
