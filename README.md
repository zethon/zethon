### Hi there üå®

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Python and other languages.

I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AddyGoesPlaces) channel where I chronical my various travels and often do **live programming**.

‚ö° Currently I am working on a video game that asks players to draw the maps üó∫Ô∏è  countries and other regions in a time-controlled setting. Check out the [GeoSketch](https://github.com/zethon/geosketch) repo!

Here are a few other projects worth mentioning: 

### Owl

Owl began as a "message board reader" or "Outlook for message boards". I would love to add Reddit support to Owl, as well release a decentralized chat system where Owl is the premiere chat client. Think of email where anyone can set up an email server and send email to anyone else, now take that concept to instant-messaging, and now you have the concept of Owl.

### AshCoin

This project began as a quest to understand the details of cryptocoins, and what better way to understand than to write your very own from scratch!

### AshDB

AshDB grew from AshCoin (hence the name) when I realized the work I was doing for a simple write-one-read-often index-based database could be its own project. T

### arcc

Another Reddit Console Client stemmed from the a desire to have a simple Reddit client that didn't require installing a zillion Javascript modules or Python libraries.
