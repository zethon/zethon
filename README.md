### Hi there 🌨

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Python and other languages.

⚡ I am currently working on a horror/survival video game where the player must not only save himself, but must also save his family. This game will feature a unique game mechanic where Players control "Friendly NPCs" (i.e the family) with complicated commands and build a unique strategy in order to win. Check out the [prototype repo](https://github.com/DogFingerStudios/Home-Prototype001)!

Here are a few other projects worth mentioning: 

### [Home (Working Title)](https://github.com/DogFingerStudios/Home-Prototype001)

A survival horror game set in a fictiona;l war-torn city in the 1940s tower. 

### [Owl](https://github.com/zethon/Owl) 🦉

Owl began as a "message board reader" or "Outlook for message boards". I would love to add Reddit support to Owl, as well release a decentralized chat system where Owl is the premiere chat client. 

### [AshCoin](https://github.com/zethon/AshCoin) 🪙

This project began as a quest to understand the details of cryptocurrencies, and what better way to understand than to write your very own from scratch!

### [AshDB](https://github.com/zethon/AshDB) 🕯️🏚️🩸

AshDB grew from AshCoin (hence the name) when I realized the work I was doing for a simple write-once-read-often index-based database could be its own project.
