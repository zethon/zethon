### Hi there ðŸŒ¨

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Python and other languages.

I have a YouTube channel where I do [live coding](https://www.youtube.com/@AddyGoesLive/streams), often with a humorous slant.

âš¡ I am currently working on a horror/survival video game where the player must not only save himself, but must also save his family. This game will feature a unique game mechanic where the player give the family member NPCs repetitive or conditional commands (e.g. "stay here until the guard comes and then run to the kitchen", or "keep hiding for two minutes and then run to the tree outside"). Check out the [prototype repo](https://github.com/DogFingerStudios/Home-Prototype001)!

Here are a few other projects worth mentioning: 

### [Owl](https://github.com/zethon/Owl) ðŸ¦‰

Owl began as a "message board reader" or "Outlook for message boards". I would love to add Reddit support to Owl, as well release a decentralized chat system where Owl is the premiere chat client. 

### [AshCoin](https://github.com/zethon/AshCoin) ðŸª™

This project began as a quest to understand the details of cryptocurrencies, and what better way to understand than to write your very own from scratch!

### [AshDB](https://github.com/zethon/AshDB)

AshDB grew from AshCoin (hence the name) when I realized the work I was doing for a simple write-once-read-often index-based database could be its own project.

### [arcc](https://github.com/zethon/arcc)

Another Reddit Console Client stemmed from the a desire to have a simple Reddit client that didn't require installing a zillion Javascript modules or Python libraries.
