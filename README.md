### Hi there üå®

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Python and other languages.

I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AddyGoesPlaces) channel where I chronical my various travels and often do **[live programming](https://www.youtube.com/@AddyGoesPlaces/streams)**.

‚ö° Currently I am working on a video game that asks players to draw the maps üó∫Ô∏è of countries and other regions in a time-controlled setting. Check out the [GeoSketch](https://github.com/zethon/geosketch) repo!

Here are a few other projects worth mentioning: 

### [Owl](https://github.com/zethon/Owl) ü¶â

Owl began as a "message board reader" or "Outlook for message boards". I would love to add Reddit support to Owl, as well release a decentralized chat system where Owl is the premiere chat client. 

### [AshCoin](https://github.com/zethon/AshCoin) ü™ô

This project began as a quest to understand the details of cryptocurrencies, and what better way to understand than to write your very own from scratch!

### [AshDB](https://github.com/zethon/AshDB)

AshDB grew from AshCoin (hence the name) when I realized the work I was doing for a simple write-once-read-often index-based database could be its own project.

### [arcc](https://github.com/zethon/arcc)

Another Reddit Console Client stemmed from the a desire to have a simple Reddit client that didn't require installing a zillion Javascript modules or Python libraries.
