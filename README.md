### Hi there ðŸŒ¨

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Perl, PHP, and recently I have been experimenting with zig.

Currently I am working on a video game that I classify as a cross between Stardew Valley and Grand Theft Auto, which you can check out [here](http://ttvg.online).
