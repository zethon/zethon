### Hi there 🌨

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am a software engineer. I mostly work in C++, but I like to use C#, Python and other languages.

⚡ Currently I am working on a video game that asks players to draw the maps 🗺️  countries and other regions in a time-controlled setting. Check out the [GeoSketch](https://github.com/zethon/geosketch) repo!

I also have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@AddyGoesPlaces) channel where I chronical my various travels and often do **live programming**.
